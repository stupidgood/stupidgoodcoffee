**Current Coffee Offering**   
_Locally roasted by Oak Cliff Coffee Roasters_  
<p>Finca Buena Vista in Antigua, Guatemala</p>
<p>Located along the Sierra Madre Mountains, ‘Buena Vista,’ meaning ‘Beautiful View,’ certainly lives up to its name as it overlooks the southern chain of volcanoes from a surreal elevation of 1900 meters. Luis Pedro Zelaya owns and operates the farm as well as the processing mill, Bella Vista. Due to the elevation, this coffee contains a remarkable complexity with notes of orange blossom, cantaloupe, graham cracker.</p>
